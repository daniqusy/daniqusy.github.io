## üìå Project 3: Astral Arc Computers

**Description:**  
Astral Arc Computers is a fully developed e-commerce website created for a hypothetical PC retailer, designed to deliver a seamless and secure online shopping experience. The platform features essential e-commerce functionalities such as a dynamic product catalog, shopping cart, and a robust checkout process, allowing users to easily browse, select, and purchase computer components or systems.

<br>

A key focus of the project was on security and data integrity. We implemented best practices to safeguard against common web vulnerabilities, including input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. All database interactions were carefully handled to ensure that sensitive user data and transactions remained protected.

<br>

**Technologies Used:**  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax
- Backend: PHP
- Database: MySQL (managed with MySQL Workbench)

<br>

**Key Features:**  
- Comprehensive Product Management: Users can browse a wide selection of PC components, view detailed product information, and add items to their shopping cart.

- Shopping Cart & Checkout: Fully functional cart system that allows users to review, update, and remove items before proceeding to a secure checkout.

- Database Security: Utilized prepared statements and rigorous input sanitization to defend against SQL injection and XSS exploits.
