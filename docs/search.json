I will discuss the tool I used, its benefits and challenges, and how GenAI may assist me in future work.\n\n\n\nI used Perplexity AI as my main GenAI tool for this assessment.\nI chose Perplexity because it provides concise, well-cited answers and supports markdown formatting, which is helpful for creating structured and readable content.\n\n\n\n\n\nIdea Generation:\nPerplexity helped me brainstorm and outline my thoughts efficiently.\nFormatting Assistance:\nThe tool provided examples of markdown syntax, such as:\n\nLists\nHyperlinks (e.g., Perplexity AI)\n\nClarification:\nWhenever I was unsure how to structure a section, I could ask for specific examples or guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaves time by quickly generating structured content.\nOffers relevant examples and explanations.\nSupports multiple markdown elements for better formatting.\nProvides clear, well-organized answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, the responses are too generic and need further customization.\nIt may not always understand highly specific or nuanced queries.\nThere is a risk of over-reliance, which could limit my own critical thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProductivity:\nGenAI can help automate repetitive writing and summarization tasks.\nLearning:\nIt can explain complex concepts in simple terms, making self-study more effective.\nCollaboration:\nGenAI can assist in drafting reports, emails, and documentation in a professional setting.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, I find GenAI tools like Perplexity to be valuable companions for both academic and professional tasks.

    "text": "Welcome to my portfolio of previous projects!\nHere, I showcase some of the key projects I have completed, highlighting my interests and skills in AI, software development, and problem-solving.\n\n\n\nDescription:\nHDBHaven is a data-driven platform designed to empower aspiring homeowners, buyers, and sellers in Singapore with actionable insights into HDB flat prices. The project leverages Python to deliver a suite of interactive visualizations, enabling users to easily explore historical trends, compare different flat types, and uncover key price patterns across locations.\n\nTechnologies Used:\n- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) - RESTful API integration (data.gov.sg) - Jupyter Notebook\n\nKey Features:\n- Real-time Data Integration: Utilized an API to continuously retrieve up-to-date HDB resale data from data.gov.sg, ensuring analyses reflect the latest market conditions.\n\nInsightful Visualizations: Developed a variety of charts and dashboards to help users intuitively understand price movements, demand hotspots, and affordability across different towns and flat types.\nPrice Prediction Model: Built and deployed a machine learning model that forecasts future resale prices for specific HDB flats, supporting more informed decision-making for buyers and sellers.\n\nLink:\nGitHub Repository\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\nSpace Shooter: Math Adventure is an educational arcade game designed to make learning math fun and engaging for kids. Developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project, the game combines classic space shooter mechanics with interactive math challenges, effectively gamifying the learning experience.\n\nTechnologies Used:\n- Java (OOP & SOLID principles) - libGDX game development framework\n\nKey Features:\n- Gamified Math Learning: Math problems are seamlessly integrated into the game, reinforcing concepts such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nEngaging Gameplay: Fast-paced space shooter action keeps players motivated and entertained as they practice math skills.\n\nLink:\nGitHub Repository\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\nAstral Arc Computers is a fully developed e-commerce website created for a hypothetical PC retailer, designed to deliver a seamless and secure online shopping experience. The platform features essential e-commerce functionalities such as a dynamic product catalog, shopping cart, and a robust checkout process, allowing users to easily browse, select, and purchase computer components or systems.\n\nA key focus of the project was on security and data integrity. We implemented best practices to safeguard against common web vulnerabilities, including input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. All database interactions were carefully handled to ensure that sensitive user data and transactions remained protected.\n\nTechnologies Used:\n- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax - Backend: PHP - Database: MySQL (managed with MySQL Workbench)\n\nKey Features:\n- Comprehensive Product Management: Users can browse a wide selection of PC components, view detailed product information, and add items to their shopping cart.\n\nShopping Cart & Checkout: Fully functional cart system that allows users to review, update, and remove items before proceeding to a secure checkout.\nDatabase Security: Utilized prepared statements and rigorous input sanitization to defend against SQL injection and XSS exploits.\n\nLink:\nGitHub Repository\n\nFeel free to explore the repositories above for more details, code, and documentation. If you have any questions about my projects or want to collaborate, please reach out!"
